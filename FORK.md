# PS5LM Lean

A modified copy of [cobanov/PS5LM](https://github.com/cobanov/PS5LM) (GPL-3.0), forked from v0.11.0
(`e2a8cf4`, 2026-11-09). It installs beside the stock app under its own title ID, **PPSA99590**, and shares
its data folder (`/data/PS5LM`: models, settings, `app-args.txt`). Run one of the two at a time.

What is changed, newest last:

- 2026-11-11: own title ID and name (`ps5/app/sce_sys/param.json`), version `0.11.0-lean.N`; CI keeps the built
  title folder as a download (`.github/workflows/native-build.yml`).
- 2026-11-11: prints never wait for storage (`ps5/app/log_sink.cpp`). stdout and stderr go through a non-blocking
  pipe into a 2 MiB memory ring, and one thread writes the ring to `app.log`. Stock PS5LM writes them straight to
  `/data`, and a slow write there stopped the whole app (cobanov/PS5LM#70). The memory line in `app.log` also gives
  the sink's figures, and a memory line comes once a second while a model loads. Host test: `log_sink_test.cpp`.
- 2026-11-11: screen-off mode. `off` on the first line of `/data/PS5LM/screen.txt` starts the app without its screen
  (no GL display, dashboard, fonts or sounds), which frees the screen's ~0.42 GiB of the pool for the model. The
  TV shows nothing from the app; notifications and the PC's request files (`load`, `unload`, `memory`, `quit`)
  still work. Any other content, or no file, keeps the screen.
- 2026-11-11: a projector pairs by its GGUF header when its name does not: a `general.type` `mmproj` file in the
  model's folder with the same `general.base_model.0.repo_url` or `general.basename` (Unsloth's `mmproj-F16.gguf`
  pairs with every Qwen3.8-27B build, no rename). The name rule still comes first; of several matches the largest
  file wins. Choosing a model in the library renames `app-args.txt` to `app-args.off.txt` instead of deleting it.

Install: download the `ps5lm-title-<commit>` artifact from the Actions run, check `eboot.bin` against
`native-ci/result.json`, and copy `app-ps5/title/PPSA99590` to `/data/homebrew/` over FTP. On OnionHEN, add
PPSA99590 to `app_jailbreak.exact_title_ids` as for the stock app.
