# The title heap's later fixes, for the pinned payload SDK

PS5LM pins the payload SDK fork `mihawk-99/PS5_PayloadSDK` at `BASE`. These are four later commits of that fork,
by its author, path-filtered to the title heap (`platform/src/heap.c`, `platform/src/dlmalloc/mspace.c`,
`platform/include/ps5platform/heap.h`) and its host tests. Each patch's message names the commit it comes from and
what of it is left out.

| Patch | SDK commit | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0001 | `8278ca5e` | calloc clears a mapped chunk: the console hands released direct memory out with its old bytes (heap part) |
| 0002 | `3752be7e` | arena locks block instead of spinning; arena set-up sleeps while it waits (heap part) |
| 0003 | `9d048784` | the heap grows in 2 MiB segments instead of 16 MiB; a segment table for 8,192 |
| 0004 | `55a2de04` | a 64 KiB gap between mappings so dlmalloc never joins segments, and a segment with nothing left in it goes back wherever it lies; `ps5_heap_trim()`; the heap's in-use figure; 32 MiB trim threshold |

`scripts/build-app.sh` exports `BASE` from the pinned checkout (`git archive`), applies these with `patch --fuzz=0`,
compiles `heap.o` and `mspace.o` with the SDK's own Makefile, and links them as `libps5lm_heap.a` ahead of
`libps5platform.a`; lld's `--why-extract` report is checked so the stock members never come in. The pinned checkout
and the SDK cache built from it are not modified, so `scripts/test-native-build.sh`'s pin checks hold, and that
script runs the SDK's host tests (`make -C platform test`) on the patched copy first.

Delete this folder once PS5LM pins the SDK at or past `55a2de04`.
