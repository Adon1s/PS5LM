// sees it, and its trim. Only heap_info.cpp includes the SDK's header, so the
// struct the heap fills is always the one it was built with: patches/sdk adds
// a field to it.
//
// With patches/sdk the heap maps its segments apart, so a segment nothing is
// left in can go back to the pool the GPU shares, and ps5_heap_trim does that.
// Without them (a stock SDK) there is no trim, and the figures have no in-use.
